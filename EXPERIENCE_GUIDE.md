## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Typography Hierarchy
1. **Cinzel** - For powerful moments (countdown, year digits)
2. **Playfair Display** - For romantic messaging (main titles, final scene)
3. **Cormorant Garamond** - For elegant body text (subtitles, messages)

### Color Psychology
- **Deep Blue/Purple Background** - Mystery, romance, night sky
- **Gold/Yellow Accents** - Celebration, warmth, optimism
- **Pink Gradients** - Romance, affection, tenderness
- **White/Cyan** - Purity, hope, new beginnings

### Animation Principles
- **Easing Functions** - Cubic-bezier curves for natural movement
- **Staggered Timing** - Elements appear sequentially, not all at once
- **Scale & Transform** - 3D depth with subtle rotation and scaling
- **Opacity Transitions** - Smooth fades prevent jarring changes
